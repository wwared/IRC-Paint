IRC Paint
=========

This project has been abandoned for an undeterminate amount of time, and this
repository is left here for archival purposes only. I recommend using
[img2term](https://www.github.com/wwared/img2term) and any actual pixel art
editor (such as [aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org) with an IRC palette) for
modern IRC art work.
