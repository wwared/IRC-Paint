You will need QtCore4.dll and QtGui4.dll for this program to run, as well as having the Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable installed. These can all either be found at the [homepage](http://paint.irc.so/) or at [github's download section](http://github.com/wwared/IRC-Paint/downloads).

f you have any questions or suggestions, try going to [irc.chatnets.net #711chan](irc://irc.chatnets.net/711chan)
